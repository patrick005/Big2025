Fly Me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby[2] kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore[A]
You are all I long for, all I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
